# ðŸ“˜ Day 03: Deep Learning (DL) â€“ Power of Neural Networks

## 1. What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a **subset of Machine Learning** that uses **multi-layered neural networks** to learn from large and complex datasets. It's inspired by how the human brain processes information using neurons.

## 2. How It Works

Architecture:  
**Input Layer â†’ Hidden Layers â†’ Output Layer**

Flow:
- Inputs enter neurons
- Each neuron multiplies input by a **weight**, adds **bias**
- An **activation function** determines output signal
- Signal is passed forward through layers to produce output

## 3. Key Components

| Component          | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Neuron**         | Unit that processes input, computes result using weight, bias & activation |
| **Weight**         | Signifies importance of an input |
| **Bias**           | Allows shifting the output (acts like external influence) |
| **Activation**     | Introduces non-linearity to help model learn complex patterns |

Common Activation Functions:
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**
- **Sigmoid**
- **Tanh**

## 4. Why Deep Learning?

| Criteria            | Machine Learning       | Deep Learning         |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Data Requirements   | Low to Medium          | High (large datasets) |
| Feature Engineering | Manual                 | Automatic              |
| Accuracy            | Moderate               | Very High              |
| Use Cases           | Basic predictions      | Advanced tasks (NLP, vision) |
