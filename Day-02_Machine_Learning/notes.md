# ðŸ“˜ Day 02: Machine Learning (ML) â€“ Core Concepts

---

## 1. What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It allows systems to automatically improve their performance over time through experience.

---

## 2. Real-Life Analogy

Just like a child identifies a mango or apple by seeing it multiple times and remembering color, shape, and texture â€” machines learn by training on many examples of data.

---

## 3. Key Components

- **Input Data**: The features fed into the model
- **Model**: The mathematical structure that learns patterns
- **Training**: Teaching the model with data
- **Prediction**: What the model outputs based on new data

---

## 4. Types of Machine Learning

### ðŸ”¹ Supervised Learning
- Trained on **labeled** data (input + output provided)
- Used for: Classification & Regression
- **Examples**:
  - Spam detection (Yes/No)
  - House price prediction

### ðŸ”¹ Unsupervised Learning
- Trained on **unlabeled** data (only inputs)
- Learns patterns or groupings (clustering)
- **Examples**:
  - Grouping customers
  - Organizing photos by faces

### ðŸ”¹ Reinforcement Learning
- Learning through **trial and error** in an environment
- Gets **rewards or penalties** based on actions
- **Examples**:
  - Game AI (like AlphaGo)
  - Self-driving cars

## 5. Core Concepts in RL

- **Agent**: The learner/decision-maker
- **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with
- **Reward**: Feedback for good/bad actions

## 6. Summary Table

| Learning Type    | Input        | Output             | Example Use Case           |
|------------------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Supervised        | Labeled       | Prediction           | Email classification        |
| Unsupervised      | Unlabeled     | Grouping             | Customer segmentation       |
| Reinforcement     | Actions + Feedback | Optimal policy   | Robot navigation            |
