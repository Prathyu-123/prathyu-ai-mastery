  - **ANI (Narrow AI):** Limited to specific tasks (e.g., ChatGPT, Face Unlock)
  - **AGI (General AI):** Hypothetical human-like intelligence
  - **ASI (Super AI):** Theoretical superintelligence beyond human capacity

- **AI vs Human:**
  - Humans think with emotions, senses, and real-world experience.
  - AI thinks using patterns, data, and mathematical models.

- **AI vs ML:**
  - AI is the broader concept.
  - ML is a subset of AI that learns from data to make predictions or decisions.
